# FAQ:

- Can I contribute?

> Sure.

- What version of Python should I use?

> Any Python version above Python 3.5 should work, but we recommend you use the latest one. **Fork note:** We'll be
> using Python 3.10 syntax, so we recommend you use that version (although Pydrum *might* work).

- Is this free?

> Yes it is.

- Is this for Minecraft Java or Bedrock?

> Its currently for bedrock but there may be a plugin for java edition.

- Can I use this yet?

> We wouldn't recommend using this for a serious project yet.

- Does it support plugins?

> Yes, it does, you can write them in Python (and maybe some other languages with some tricks).

- I have a question that isn't answered here, where can I ask it?

> On our [discord](https://discord.gg/nTRSnwHeQz).
